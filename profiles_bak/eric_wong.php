$bioText="<br />I am a Ph.D. student in the physics department here at Penn. I received my undergraduate degree from 

the University of Chicago in 2010, and my background is in condensed matter physics with a bit 

chemistry. <br /><br />

<center>Research Interests</center><br />

I am broadly interested in the links between the structure and properties of matter on atomic, nano, 

and macro scales. Specifically, I am most interested in examining the origins of complexity in 

nanocrystalline electronics. Most of my work centers on the transport physics of charge carriers in 

arrays of quantum dots with differing degrees of short- and long-range order, helping to clarify the 

correct physical models for understanding how charges move in quantum dot solids of varying 

complexity.";
