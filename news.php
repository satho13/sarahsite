		High yield, functional 3D cell-sized machines are achieved by ligand-chemistry-induced folding of planar nanocrystal/bulk hetero-structures. Design rules have been established to fabricate various 3D architectures and unique physical functions can be incorporated through careful selection of nanocrystals. This technique promises to find applications in a variety of fields including artificial motors, nano-robots, and chiral optical metasurfaces.

	<br><br>
		2D hybrid perovskites are widely tailorable in composition, structure, and dimensionality and provide an intriguing playground for the solid-state chemistry and physics communities to uncover structure-property relationships. In this Perspective, we correlate the unique structural and optoelectronic properties in semiconducting 2D perovskites and discuss current and future applications for this diverse class of materials. We describe the role of the heavy atoms in the inorganic framework; the geometry and chemistry of organic cations; and the "softness" of the organic-inorganic lattice on the electronic structure and dynamics of electrons, excitons, and phonons that govern the physical properties of these materials.

We find that the hole diffusion length is on average an order of magnitude longer than the electron diffusion length, irrespective of the A cation.

Nanoscrytal-derived superparamagnetism prevents these nanorods from spontaneous magnetic-dipole-induced aggregation, while their magnetic anisotropy makes them responsive to an external field. Ligand exchange drives Au nanocrystal fusion and forms a porous network, imparting the nanorods with high mechanical strength and polarization-dependent, infrared surface plasmon resonances. The combined superparamagnetic and plasmonic functions enable switching of the infrared transmission of a hybrid nanorod suspension using an external magnetic field.

The increase in mobility and lifetime is consistent with increased indium passivating midgap and band-tail trap states and doping the films, shifting the Fermi energy closer to and into the conduction band.

	<br><br>
		Arrays of subwavelength holes (nanoholes) in Au films were computationally designed, fabricated and used as templates to localize and enhance the luminescence of upconversion nanophosphors. Enhancements of up to 35-fold and a concomitant shortening of the UCNP luminescence rise time were observed, consistent with simulations of plasmonic enhancement of the UCNP absorption.<br>

	<br><br>
		We manipulate the stoichiometry of Pb-chalcogenide nanocrystal arrays through thermal evaporation of Pb or Se to engineer their carrier statistics. Excess Pb forms NC FETs with electron mobilities of 10 cm2/Vs and excess Se form Schottky solar cells with enhanced power conversion efficiency.<br>

	<br><br>
		We design optical metamaterials using colloidal gold nanocrystal building blocks, tailoring the dielectric permitivity of the solid by exchanging the nanocrystals' surface-capping molecules. Direct, wide-area nanoimprinting of subwavelength superstructures affords plasmonic resonances with tunability ranging from 660 to 1070 nm.<br>

		We report solution-deposited nanocrystal integrated circuits (NCICs), showing NCIC inverters, amplifiers, and ring oscillators, constructed from high-performance, low-voltage, low-hysteresis CdSe nanocrystal field-effect transistors (FETs). We fabricated nanocrystal FETs and NCICs from colloidal inks on flexible plastic substrates that operate at low voltage.<br>

		We report luminescence enhancement of upconversion nanophosphors (UCNPs) that depends on the separation between the UCNPs and metal NPs with enhancement of up to 5.2-fold proximal to Au NPs and up to 45-fold proximal to Ag NPs arising from resonant plasmonic coupling and non-resonant near field-enhancement from the metal NPs.<br>

		In ACS Nano we show single, strongly quantum confined single crystalline PbSe nanowires behave as Schottky barrier FETs. Surface species allow for remote doping with no evidence of impurity scattering at low temperatures, providing a promising route to dope nanostructures.	<br>

		Exploiting wrinkles and deep folds that form on polymer surfaces when subjected to mechanical stress we show in Nature Photonics that light is guided and retained in the photoactive regions of photovoltaics to increase external quantum efficiency particularly in the NIR where light is otherwise minimally absorbed.	<br>
