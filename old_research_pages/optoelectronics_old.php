			The interaction of light with matter is of fundamental and technological interest. In the Kagan group we use cw and time- and spatially-resolved optical and optoelectronic spectroscopies and AC and DC electrical spectroscopies to understand the fate of photoexcitations and the processes giving rise to the emission and transfer of excitations and the separation and transport of charge in nanocrystalline and organic semiconductors. Building on our fundamental understanding, we design materials and devices that interconvert light and electricity in the examples of light-emitting diodes, photovoltaics and photodetectors. 		</div>

					We construct an apparatus to spatially resolve and correlate photoluminescence and photoconductivity in materials and their devices. For examples, we use this apparatus to map photoconductivity in nanocrystalline and organic materials and in fabricated solar photovoltaics to understand inhomogeneities that are intentionally introduced at the material or device level or that develop during device operation.

					We use thermal evaporation and diffusion to introduce atoms at the nanocrystal surface. These atoms can be used to introduce extrinsic atoms (e.g. indium at the surface of CdSe nanocrystals) or to engineer the nanocrystal stoichiometry (e.g. introduce excess lead or selenium to PbSe nanocrystals). For example below, the lead chalcogenides are non-stoichiometric semiconductors - - as we enrich the nanocrystal thin films in lead, they becomes increasingly n-type, and as we enrich the films in selenium, they becomes increasingly p-type. Tailoring the surface composition of nanocrystals provides a route to control thin film carrier statistics.  					<br /><br />

					Schematic of lead chalcogenide (PbE) nanocrystal thin films enriched by thermal evaporation and diffusion with excess lead and excess selenium to n- and p-dope the nanocrystal thin films respectively. Example of capacitance-voltage measurements used to extract the carrier type and concentration of lead selenide nanocrystal thin films with increasing amounts of deposited lead or selenium. Tailoring the amount of excess metal or chalcogen allows us to tune the carrier concentration from 1015-1020/cm3, and therefore from intrinsic to degenerately n- or p-doped.  					</div>

					We also use solution-based methods to introduce adatoms at the nanocrystal surface to engineer carrier type and concentration and to passivate the nanocrystal surface. In particular, we use a post-synthesis colloidal atomic layer deposition method to tailor the nanocrystal surface after integration in devices. Manipulating the nanocrystal surfaces after deposition avoids possible changes in surface composition upon solution-based deposition and ligand exchange. For example, in lead chalcogenide nanocrystal thin films we exchange the ligands used in synthesis and enrich the surface in chalcogen by treatment with a chalcogenide salt and then enrich the surface in lead and chloride using lead chloride. We showed that the chalcogen-rich nanocrystal surface is structurally, optically and electronically unstable, whereas treatment with lead chloride creates a well-passivated, stable nanocrystal thin film.

Schematic of stepwise post-synthesis, colloidal atomic layer deposition by treatment with a chalcogenide salt, exchanging the long surface ligands used in synthesis and enriching the surface in chalcogen, and with lead chloride, enriching the surface in lead. Note: a structural change is seen upon exchange from hexagonally-ordered domains to square-ordered domains as the nanocrystals fuse (scale bar: 20 nm). Optical absorption spectra of as-synthesized (black), chalcogen-enriched (blue) and subsequently lead-enriched (red) nanocrystal thin films. Transfer characteristics reflect the change in carrier statistics as chalcogen-enriched nanocrystal thin films are degenerately p-doped (black) and with more lead enrichment (from blue to green to red) become increasingly n-type.
