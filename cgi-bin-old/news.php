	<br><br>
		We report a simple, solution-based, post-synthetic colloidal, atomic layer deposition (PS-cALD) process to engineer stepwise the surface stoichiometry and therefore the electronic properties of lead chalcogenide nanocrystal (NC) thin films integrated in devices. We found that unlike chalcogen-enriched NC surfaces that are structurally, optically and electronically unstable, lead chloride treatment creates a well-passivated shell that stabilizes the NCs. Using PS-cALD of lead chalcogenide NC thin films we demonstrate high electron field-effect mobilities of ~4.5 cm2/Vs. <br>

	<br><br>
		We describe a room-temperature, chemical process to transform silver nanocrystal solids, deposited from colloidal solutions, into highly conductive, corrosion-resistant, optical and electronic materials with nanometer-scale architectures. We show ammonium thiocyanate uniquely form low-resistivity, optically smooth thin films that can be patterned by imprint lithography to form conductive electrodes and plasmonic mesostructures with programmable resonances. <br>

	<br><br>
		We demonstrate thermally switchable VO2 metamaterials by combining nanoimprinting and solution-based deposition of colloidal nanocrystals. We tuned the phase change temperature by W-doping the NCs and fabricated differentially-doped, multilayered materials to tailor the optical response in the near-IR and IR from that of a strong light absorber to that of a Drude like reflector with a change in temperature.  <br>

		<b><a href="http://kagan.seas.upenn.edu/publications.php?year=2013">Solution-Based Stoichiometric Control over Charge Transport in Nanocrystalline CdSe Devices</a></b>
	<br><br>
		We demonstrate a mild, room-temperature, wet-chemical process to chemically manipulate the atomic composition of and thereby dope CdSe nanowires (NWs) in completed devices; where Cd enhances electron currents and chalcogens suppresses them. Subsequent thermal diffusion of the n-dopant indium depends on the surface composition, consistent with an indium-chalcogen interaction at the surface rather than in the NW core and with differences observed in CdSe nanocrystal devices.<br>

		<b><a href="http://kagan.seas.upenn.edu/publications.php?year=2013">In-situ Repair for Large-Area Fabrication and Air-stable Operation of Nanocrystal Electronics</a></b>
	<br><br>
		We introduce an in-situ chemical agent, namely indium metal that is thermally triggered to diffuse and repair trap states in semiconductor nanocrystals created upon air and solvent exposure. Exploiting the recovery, we show nanocrystal devices may be fabricated in air using conventional cleanroom technologies to realize large-area and flexible nanocrystal field-effect transistors that operate in air stably over months.<br>

	<br><br>
		Selected as Physical Review Letter's Editor's Suggestion, the Kagan and Engheta groups collaborated to demonstrate through experiment and theory and simulation metatronic nanocircuitry operating in the near-infrared (NIR). Devices are based on plasmonic transparent conducting oxide nanorods. <br>

		<b><a href="http://kagan.seas.upenn.edu/publications.php?year=2013">Plasmonic Enhancement of Nanophosphor Upconversion</a></b>
	<br><br>
		Arrays of subwavelength holes (nanoholes) in Au films were computationally designed, fabricated and used as templates to localize and enhance the luminescence of upconversion nanophosphors. Enhancements of up to 35-fold and a concomitant shortening of the UCNP luminescence rise time were observed, consistent with simulations of plasmonic enhancement of the UCNP absorption.<br>

	<br><br>
		We manipulate the stoichiometry of Pb-chalcogenide nanocrystal arrays through thermal evaporation of Pb or Se to engineer their carrier statistics. Excess Pb forms NC FETs with electron mobilities of 10 cm2/Vs and excess Se form Schottky solar cells with enhanced power conversion efficiency.<br>

		<b><a href="http://kagan.seas.upenn.edu/publications.php?year=2012">Nanoimprinted Nanocrystal Metamaterials</a></b>
	<br><br>
		We design optical metamaterials using colloidal gold nanocrystal building blocks, tailoring the dielectric permitivity of the solid by exchanging the nanocrystals' surface-capping molecules. Direct, wide-area nanoimprinting of subwavelength superstructures affords plasmonic resonances with tunability ranging from 660 to 1070 nm.<br>

		We report solution-deposited nanocrystal integrated circuits (NCICs), showing NCIC inverters, amplifiers, and ring oscillators, constructed from high-performance, low-voltage, low-hysteresis CdSe nanocrystal field-effect transistors (FETs). We fabricated nanocrystal FETs and NCICs from colloidal inks on flexible plastic substrates that operate at low voltage.<br>

		We report luminescence enhancement of upconversion nanophosphors (UCNPs) that depends on the separation between the UCNPs and metal NPs with enhancement of up to 5.2-fold proximal to Au NPs and up to 45-fold proximal to Ag NPs arising from resonant plasmonic coupling and non-resonant near field-enhancement from the metal NPs.<br>

	<br><br>
		In ACS Nano we show single, strongly quantum confined single crystalline PbSe nanowires behave as Schottky barrier FETs. Surface species allow for remote doping with no evidence of impurity scattering at low temperatures, providing a promising route to dope nanostructures.	<br>

	<br><br>
		Exploiting wrinkles and deep folds that form on polymer surfaces when subjected to mechanical stress we show in Nature Photonics that light is guided and retained in the photoactive regions of photovoltaics to increase external quantum efficiency particularly in the NIR where light is otherwise minimally absorbed.	<br>
