$researchTitle="Nanocrystal Transport";

$researchSummary="Nanocrystal assemblies have been coined “artificial solids.” Charge injection and transport is of fundamental interest, to understand the cooperative interactions that develop and the delocalization of quantum confined electronic wavefunctions as nanocrystal building blocks are brought into increasingly strong coupling in the solid state. Transport studies are also of technological importance, as semiconductor nanocrystals are promising for a range of electronic, optoelectronic and thermoelectric applications. In the Kagan group, we use a wide range of electronic and optical spectroscopies to probe the nature and evolution of charge transport in nanocrystal thin films as we use ligand exchange chemistries, to control the interparticle distance and the strength of electronic coupling, and surface chemical modification, to passivate surface states and dope the nanocrystal thin films.";

	array("Extended State Transport in Nanocrystal FETs",
 "We combine ligand exchange, with the compact thiocyanate, and nanocrystal surface passivation and doping, through thermal evaporation and diffusion of indium to demonstrate high electron mobilities of ~27 cm2/Vs in CdSe nanocrystal field-effect transistors (FETs).  The high mobility charge transport and the increase in mobility with decreasing temperature are signatures of the evolution from hopping between localized states to bandlike transport through extended electronic states in these strongly coupled nanocyrstal solids. Reduction of the semiconductor nanocrystal-gate dielectric interface states through the selection of the gate oxide material and passivation and doping of the nanocrystals with indium is necessary to fill tail and mid-gap states and shift the Fermi energy toward the conduction band to allow electrons to occupy and be transported through extended electronic states.",

"Output and transfer characteristics of high mobility CdSe nanocrystal transistors fabricated by spincoating thiocyanate exchanged nanocrystals and thermally evaporating and diffusing indium upon annealing at 250 oC. Temperature-dependent electrical measurements show a region of increased carrier mobility with decreasing temperature; the width of this region is increased by reducing the density of trap states at the nanocrystal-gate dielectric interface. Schematic of the evolution and mechanism of charge transport as isolated nanocrystals with localized electronic wavefunctions are brought into strong coupling through ligand exchange and annealing to form extended states, which become occupied by electrons as interface and surface states are passivated and the nanocrystal thin film is doped."),

	array("Stoichiometric Control of Carrier Statistics", 
"We control the stoichiometry of nanocrystal thin films and therefor the carrier statistics and polarity of charge transport in nanocrystal thin film solids. For example, in lead chalcogenide nanocrystal thin films introduction of excess lead, a low lying donor in the lead chalcogenides, n-dopes the thin films. In complement, the addition of excess chalcogen, an acceptor in the lead chalcogenides, p-dopes the thin films. We use stoichiometric imbalance to control the carrier type, concentration and mobility of carriers in nanocrystal thin films and demonstrate electron mobilities of 10 cm2/Vs in lead chalcogenide nanocrystal thin films.",

Transfer characteristics of PbSe nanocrystal thin film transistors as a function of increased amount of evaporated lead and of evaporated selenium."),

	array("Post-Synthesis Control", 
"We also use solution-based methods to introduce adatoms at the nanocrystal surface to engineer carrier type and concentration and to passivate the nanocrystal surface. In particular, we use a post-synthesis colloidal atomic layer deposition method to tailor the nanocrystal surface after integration in devices. Manipulating the nanocrystal surfaces after deposition avoids possible changes in surface composition upon solution-based deposition and ligand exchange. For example, in lead chalcogenide nanocrystal thin films we exchange the ligands used in synthesis and enrich the surface in chalcogen by treatment with a chalcogenide salt and then enrich the surface in lead and chloride using lead chloride. We showed that the chalcogen-rich nanocrystal surface is structurally, optically and electronically unstable, whereas treatment with lead chloride creates a well-passivated, stable nanocrystal thin film.", 
"Nanocrystal Transport Example 3.png", 
"Schematic of stepwise post-synthesis, colloidal atomic layer deposition by treatment with a chalcogenide salt, exchanging the long surface ligands used in synthesis and enriching the surface in chalcogen, and with lead chloride, enriching the surface in lead. Note: a structural change is seen upon exchange from hexagonally-ordered domains to square-ordered domains as the nanocrystals fuse (scale bar: 20 nm). Optical absorption spectra of as-synthesized (black), chalcogen-enriched (blue) and subsequently lead-enriched (red) nanocrystal thin films. Transfer characteristics reflect the change in carrier statistics as chalcogen-enriched nanocrystal thin films are degenerately p-doped (black) and with more lead enrichment (from blue to green to red) become increasingly n-type.
