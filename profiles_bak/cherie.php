	Cherie earned both a B.S.E. in Materials Science and Engineering and a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1991. In 1996, she received her Ph.D. in Electronic Materials from MIT. In 1996, Cherie went to Bell Laboratories as a Postdoctoral Fellow. In 1998 she joined IBM’s T. J. Watson Research Center where she most recently managed the “Molecular Assemblies and Devices Group.” 

	<br><br>
	In January, 2007 Cherie joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania. She served as the Director of the University’s Nanofabrication facility from 2007 to 2009 and the University of Pennsylvania’s Director to the Energy Commercialization Initiative, a multi-institutional partnership funded by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to accelerate commercialization of clean, alternative energy technologies from 2009 to 2011. Cherie is a co-founding director of Pennergy: The Penn Center for Energy Innovation (2009-present).
