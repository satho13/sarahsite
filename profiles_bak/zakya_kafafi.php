				Dr. Zakya Kafafi is presently on sabbatical leave from the National Science Foundation (NSF). She was the Director of the Division of Materials Research at NSF during 2007-2010.  She is an adjunct professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Lehigh University.  Dr. Kafafi spent 20 years at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) where she was a Group Leader in the Optical Sciences Division. She established and was the Head of the Organic Optoelectronics Section. 
				<br><br>
				Zakya's research interests focus on newly emerging technologies in organic electronics and photonics, spanning a wide spectrum of disciplines in condensed matter and materials research. The development and characterization of organic semiconductors, light-emitting materials and diodes, and light-harvesting and photovoltaic devices using optical, fluorescence, and electroluminescence spectroscopies represent some of the research topics pursued in Kafafi's group at NRL. Energy and charge transfer processes were studied using steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence.  The surface and interface properties of nanostructures, molecular and polymeric materials were investigated using photoemission spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy. Dr. Kafafi is the editor of more than 20 books and conference proceeding volumes. She published more than 200 manuscripts, review articles, and book chapters, in addition to several US patents. She received the Thomas Edison Patent Award for the invention of a simple and an economic method for patterning conducting polymer electrodes, and the IR 100 Award for the invention of  "Cryolink."

				Dr. Kafafi is the Founding Editor and Editor-in-Chief of the new electronic Journal of Photonics for Energy. She serves on the Advisory Board of the IEEE Photonics Journal. She chairs the annual SPIE Symposium on Photonic Devices and Applications and Conference on Organic Photovoltaics. She is a member of the American Chemical Society (ACS), the Materials Research Society (MRS), and Sigma Xi. She is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the Optical Society of America (OSA), and the International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE).
