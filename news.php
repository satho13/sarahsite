	<br><br>
	Mesoscopic quantum systems exhibit complex many-body quantum phenomena, where interactions between spins and charges give rise to collective modes and topological states. Even simple, non-interacting theories display a rich landscape of energy states --- distinct many-particle configurations connected by spin- and energy-dependent transition rates. The collective energy landscape is difficult to characterize or predict, especially in regimes of frustration where many-body effects create a multiply degenerate landscape. Here we use network science to characterize the complex interconnection patterns of these energy-state transitions.

	<b><a href="publications.php?year=2019">Imaging a nitrogen-vacancy center with a diamond immersion metalens</a></b>
	<br><br>
	In this letter, we image an individual quantum emitter, an isolated nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, using a dielectric metalens composed of subwavelength pillars etched into the diamond's surface. The metalens eliminates the need for an objective by operating as a high-transmission-efficiency immersion lens with a numerical aperture (NA) greater than 1.0. This design provides a scalable approach for fiber coupling solid-state quantum emitters that will enable the development of deployable quantum devices.

	<br><br>
		Recently, the van der Waals material hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has emerged as a robust host for quantum emitters, promising efficient photon extraction and atom-scale engineering, but observations of spin-related effects have remained thus far elusive. Here, we report room-temperature observations of strongly anisotropic photoluminescence patterns as a function of applied magnetic field for select quantum emitters in h-BN.<br><br>
